## Project Description
This project is for an Online Cake Ordering System. (CAKE HUT)
There are mainly 2 types of users: Customer and Shop Owner. CAKE HUT is acting as a platform to buy and 
sell cakes online. Shop owners can add their cake shop profile to our system and they can add their available 
cake types, designs, etc. Then a customer can view the shops and cake designs provided by them. Then they can 
order a selected cake though the system. Or they can choose a shop and they can request a cake design by 
uploading an image. The relevant shop will get the order request. When the cake is ready, customer can choose 
to pay from debit/credit card and can be delivered to a given address.
